# Real-Time Tracking App

This is a Real-Time Tracking Application built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, and Leaflet. The application allows users to track and visualize the movement of objects or users in real-time on a map.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Tracks the location of objects or users in real-time.
- **Interactive Map:** Uses Leaflet.js for displaying the map with markers indicating the tracked locations.
- **WebSocket Communication:** Uses Socket.IO for bi-directional communication between the client and server to update locations in real-time.
- **Express.js Backend:** Handles the server-side logic, including serving the client application and managing WebSocket connections.
- **Scalable and Efficient:** Built to handle multiple connections and real-time updates efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment used for building the server-side of the application.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js used to build the backend of the application.
- **Socket.IO:** Enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the server and clients.
- **Leaflet.js:** An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-tracking-app.git
cd real-time-tracking-app
```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
```
npm install
```

3. **Run the server:**
```
npm start
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Open the app:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

2. Tracking:
- The app will display a map with real-time tracking data.
- Connect to the server via WebSocket to start receiving location updates.
- The markers on the map will update in real-time as new location data is received.

## Configuration
- Port Configuration: The server runs on port 3000 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
- Map Configuration: Leaflet.js is used to display the map. You can configure the map's initial view and other settings in the client-side JavaScript code.
